Since we decided to move with javagaming as the base for graphics and GUI, I decided to rebuild
the current system.

install the SAGE zip file and go from there. it's the basis for graphics. 

for now i'm going to create two cichlids and a plant structure and then look into building buttons
and see how they react.

going to wait on thomas to see how rules can apply to this. might as well email gordon too.
